Interim report 6.3.2023 - Project start

Project has been initialized as an sbt project. Scalafmt for formatting, Wartremover for linting have been configured.
Necessary libraries, such as ScalaFX, have been installed. Mostly GUI elements created. Especially stuff related to maps have
been created - Map-class, both UI and Logic, have been done. Map-class has initializeMap-method implemented, which can read
a map file and create a 2D array of Tile-(sub)classes. Simple main menu and gameplay UI have been initialized. Still some
pondering to do on what classes should be created, for example do we need one Gameplay-class for Logic and UI both, or only
one unlike in the original plan. Basic Enemy-classes created. Also managed to test with animations (not in remote yet).

No functionality tested yet. Trying to get more grasp on the project before starting to do the tests, as the class structure
may still change radically.

There was a difficult problem when working with ScalaFX-library and lazy variables - stage and lazy vals weren't working that well.
In the end there was an easy solution - set stage's scene after defining lazy values seemed to work.

Workload has been about 15 hours.

In my opinion, I am in a decent phase of the project. I have implemented the Gameplay-UI quite well and it's easy to scale it in the 
future. Testing starts during the next two weeks when the structure of the project is clearer.
