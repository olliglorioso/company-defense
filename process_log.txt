Interim report 6.3.2023 - Project start

Project has been initialized as an sbt project. Scalafmt for formatting, Wartremover for linting have been configured.
Necessary libraries, such as ScalaFX, have been installed. 

When it comes to starting the project code, I first created three packages: Logic, UI and Util, each having code related to
their name. Util will have some helper functions and classes which don't land to neither Logic nor UI. Then I created a
several files and classe. Bullet, Enemy, Game, GameObject, Gameplay, Map and Tower in Logic. GameplayUI, MainMenuUI,
MainUI and SettingsUI in UI. In addition, I created resources-folder and added a couple items there. This folder will have all
the images and sprites. 

Then, I started with UI, MainUI in particular. I created three scenes, and a logic that they can be switched between. Main menu
has two buttons that lead to either GameplayUI or SettingsUI. SettingsUI has a button that leads back to MainUI. Most of the work
has been done with Gameplay UI. It has logic that when given a Map-class, it can create a grid of blocks that represent the map.
Also sidebar has been created and it shows a couple tower buttons already. 

In the Logic-package I have been mostly working with Map-class. It has now initializeMap-method, which can read a map from a file
and create a 2D Array of Tile-(sub)classes. Util has FileHandler-class which is utilized in the abovementioned. Enemy-class implemented
and its getHit-function. No use for these yet.

No functionality tested yet. Trying to get more grasp on the project before starting to do the tests, as the class structure
may still change radically.

There was a difficult problem when working with ScalaFX-library and lazy variables - stage and lazy vals weren't working that well.
In the end there was an easy solution - set stage's scene after defining lazy values seemed to work.

Workload has been about 15 hours.

In my opinion, I am in a decent phase of the project. I have implemented the Gameplay-UI quite well and it's easy to scale it in the 
future. Testing starts during the next two weeks when the structure of the project is clearer.
